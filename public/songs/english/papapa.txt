You’re one of those teasing passing showers
Don’t just act all kind to the people who’re pulling pranks on you
Or else it’ll absorb all of that, and grow into a full bloom
This flower deep within the depths of my heart
What it’s called? It’s a flower called love

Its honey-sweet scent, and how it prickles my heart
Shows that it’s just a little poisonous
It’ll definitely wilt without you around
That much, I know for sure

The red flower has sprung into full bloom
You won’t find it in any encyclopedias out there
It’s the first of its kind to be found, that’s why I want you to see it
But for some reason you just don’t seem interested in it 

Even when I knock, nobody answers
The door towards you remains locked even now
Even so, I don’t resent you, that’s the strangest thing about this
Look here, the flower has already started blooming

I can’t do anything about it now
Look here, the flower has already started blooming

I’ve heard this from somewhere, that giving a tree barely enough water
Is exactly the right thing to do for it to grow sweet, sweet fruit
I’d like to believe that, if only to make myself feel better
The flower deep within the depths of my heart
Will definitely turn into a sweet, sweet fruit someday

In a magazine corner somewhere, I remember reading this
That I should maintain a delicate balance between near and far
But I want to dash straight at you, not pull away
I’m sure you realize at least that, right?

I want to make you turn back at me
With a phrase that’ll surprise even you
How should I call out to you? Should I call you by some weird nickname?
Hey, stop pretending you can’t hear me!

Pressing down on the shutter with a zoomed-in lens
The film with you on it, a little out-of-focus
Even so, I’m having so much fun, that’s the strangest thing about this
Look here, the flower has already started blooming

Even if you its branches have only grown by some millimeters, that still means it’s growing
I’ll make sure you can tell, even if you’re a thousand kilometers away
And I’ll make sure you can’t pretend not to see it anymore
Yup, definitely, that’s what I need to do, right?

I’m not even trying to contain these overflowing emotions of mine
Actually, I never had the intention to even try
This, and everything else, is all thanks to you

The red flower has sprung into full bloom
You won’t find it in any encyclopedias out there
It’s the first of its kind to be found, that’s why I want you to see it
But for some reason you just don’t seem interested in it 

Even when I knock, nobody answers
The door towards you remains locked even now
Even so, I don’t resent you, that’s the strangest thing about this
Look here, the flower has already started blooming

I can’t do anything about it now
Look here, the flower has already started blooming
