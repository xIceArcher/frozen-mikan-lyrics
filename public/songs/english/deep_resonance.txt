Is this where hope is born, and where it is left to die?
No, that's not it, my flaming soul shouts out in my heart

(Fly High) I want to put up an even bigger fight
(Hurry Up) I want to believe, even more than before
(Even More) The one truth I finally realized is...

Nothing will come true if you stay silent
Nothing will come true if you just keep wishing
Right now's the time to get moving

Pain and sighs prey on your dreams
Your voice, reaching no one, resound through the night
I won't accept such a sad world
I can't bear to lay my eyes on such a world
I can feel the resonance between you and I

Let's make our voices resound through the night
