The only thing I wish for
Is to quietly melt into the warm foot bath up to my ankles, alone
But, water, like ice, splashes over me
Although the only thing I did was to walk by

The crickets in the alleyways, that have gone silent
The sweets at the candy store, that have gone scentless
I know, that it's all your fault
So give my summer back to me

Ah, it's spinning and spinning
I know that this isn't summer's fault
Nor is it the faraway sky's fault
"It's hot, isn't it?"
A forced smile, from those words you say
The only thing I hear is malice

Only my back feels the breeze through my blouse
It sticks to my body, transparent in a pale, fantastical color
There's something different today, or is it just wishful thinking?
But I have yet to notice your trap

The wild cat, that has gone missing
The watermelon, lukewarm and tasteless
I know, that it's all your fault
So give my summer back to me

Ah, it's spinning and spinning
I know that this isn't the heat's fault
Nor is it the blue sky's fault
From your face
Covered in ice cream
The only thing I sense is malice

The fireworks, that never go off
The sounds, that never resonate in my heart
Even though I know that it's all your fault
My summer has been enslaved by you

That's why

Ah, it's spinning and spinning
I'm sure I'm not the only one
I know, that it's because of how unfair you are
From a glimpse of your face
That was lit up for just a moment
The only thing I sense is malice

The only thing I see is a flash of red
