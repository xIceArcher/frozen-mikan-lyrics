Because I was crying when I was born
I want to laugh as much as I can, to make up for that
Because I've always had wings on my back
I've never envied being able to soar high up in the clouds

If you look closely at the pitch-black sky
I'd like to believe that each and every person
Has a light within them, just like the stars

I want to shine on you, the light of my wishes
But, if I'm alone, I won't even know what color I am
That's why I want to stay beside you, just like the sun and the moon
I'm only able to shine because I'm beside you
Hey, if only you thought that way too
Wouldn't the world be amazing?

When I have nothing, I'll get uneasy and want to collect everything
But, when I have too much, I'll end up wanting to throw some away
We live in this cycle of proximity and distance
We're shooting stars, sketching out paths of self-indulgence

But, in the distant sky, placed there by someone
I'd like to believe that each and every person
Has the amazing power to make a wish come true

I want to shine on you, my flight tracing out a path
But, if I'm alone, I won't even know where I am
That's why I want to stay beside you, even if I'm not reflected in your eyes
But I'm certain that there's some form of attraction between us
Hey, if only our nights could become just a little brighter
Wouldn't the world be amazing?

"I want to shine on you"
Just this tiny, insignificant wish
Is everything I can offer right now

I want to shine on you, the light of my wishes
But, if I'm alone, I won't even know what color I am
That's why I want to stay beside you, just like the sun and the moon
I'm only able to shine because I'm beside you
Hey, if only you thought that way too
Wouldn't the world be amazing?

Wouldn't the world be amazing?
