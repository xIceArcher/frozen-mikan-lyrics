My textbooks, hidden
Graffiti behind my desk
Shrill laughter resounding in the bathroom
A mere dog's bark
Feels like someone shouting at me
The friends that I trusted up till yesterday
I see nothing but their backs now

Apparently, just believing
What you're told, without question
Is something only idiots do
So, please, someone
Shout out at my idiotic self, that I'm cute

The four-leaved clover that I picked
You snatched it away from me, laughing
My lone, tiny fragment of happiness
Was snatched away from me, and thrown aside
The words of anger I exhaled
You listened to them, laughing
And you ignored them
Playing with my heart

The evening sun's rays shine down on me
Enveloping me in its warm embrace
It melts and reveals the path of my tears
Who should I trust?
You took a look at my heart
Stained with the answers I cannot find
And grew tired of it, throwing it aside

The adults, who sing words of prevention
They're just there to hide its existence
So please, think of the people
Who rely on those idiotic adults

Apparently, just believing
What you're told, without question
Is something only idiots do
So, please, someone
Shout out at my idiotic self, that I'm cute

The four-leaved clover that I picked
You snatched it away from me, laughing
My lone, tiny fragment of happiness
Was snatched away from me, and thrown aside
The words of anger I exhaled
You listened to them, laughing
And you ignored them
Playing with my heart

Where does happiness lie?
"Please... Think of how I feel..."
