If only your house were just another metre away
That’s what I was wishing for on our way home together
The evening is just too short
For me to say everything I want to say

You wave your right hand, saying “See you tomorrow”
As if trying to wipe clean a fogged-up piece of glass
 “I want to stay with you”, and all the other things I couldn’t to say
I wonder if you’ll be able to see through them

Being lonely while I’m alone is proof that I’m not alone
Being lonely when saying farewell is proof that you’re right beside me
Not being able to touch, not being here with me
But I can still feel your warmth, right beside me

Laughing out loud for every little thing
Getting a heartache that makes my chest hurt
Me looking forward to tomorrow, I’m sure
Everything, everything, is because you’re here with me

If I were a little taller, maybe, just a few centimetres
Would I be able to know more about the world you see every day?
The distance between us I close as I tiptoe
Is taller than any wall in this world 

“See you tomorrow”, you turn back, walking away from me
With your back turned to me, I become clueless to many things
Like your expression, or what’s currently on your mind
I can only imagine them

Being uneasy about the many things that I don’t know
Is proof that my heart is ready to receive brand-new emotions
Not being able to see them now, not being aware of them yet
Makes finally finding them even more joyful

Just a short farewell can feel like an eternity
But memories together feel like they pass by in a flash
I’ll fall in love again tomorrow, and I’m sure
Everything, everything, is because you’re here with me

“I want to stay with you”, and all the other things I couldn’t say
I hope I can say them tomorrow…

Being lonely while I’m alone is proof that I’m not alone
Being lonely when saying farewell is proof that you’re right beside me
Not being able to touch, not being here with me
But I can still feel your warmth, right beside me

Laughing out loud for every little thing
Getting a heartache that makes my chest hurt
Me looking forward to tomorrow, I’m sure
Everything, everything, is because you’re here with me
It’s because you’re here with me
