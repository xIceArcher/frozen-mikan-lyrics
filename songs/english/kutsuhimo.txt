Using my untied shoelaces as an excuse
I stop you in your steps, buying myself more time
What should I talk about next? I'm having a strategy meeting in my head
I'll take as much time as I can tying them

Unlike the time that flows by us
I can't seem to neatly tie up these tangled words of mine

I want to get closer to you
But I can't say something like that yet
If I actually said that, you'd probably laugh and say it's unlike me
If only our hands could be joined together
Like these tight butterfly knots here in my shoelaces

Why is it that the emotions I want to express the most
When I put them into words, they become the hardest words to say in the world

Just like a prince? No, that's a little off
Maybe a mysterious wizard that nobody has noticed?

I want to get closer to you
Just walking beside you isâ€¦
Even these worn sneakers feel like glass shoes to me now
If only my stubborn personality could come loose
Like the tight knots here in my shoelaces

Would the phrase "I love you"
Seem a little too dramatic?
Ah, I'm so frustrated, I'm so happy
How am I do describe what I'm feeling with any other words?

I want to get closer to you
I would never consider that for anyone other than you
If I manage to say it, please don't laugh and pay attention to what I'm saying
I want our hands to be joined together
Like these tight butterfly knots here in my shoelaces
As tightly knotted as the knots here in my shoelaces
