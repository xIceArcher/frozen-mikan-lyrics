I've always wanted to be a hero, rather than a heroine
Rather than being protected, I wanted to protect others
I've become stronger than I was before
But I still can't hide the fastener on my back

Through my suit, I wipe away someone's tears
But through my mask, I still can't wipe away my own

The belt I use to transform and my magical wand
They've stopped working at some point
If I could just throw all these away and face you head on
Will you be smiling when you see me?
Will you be the one to wipe away my tears?

I sometimes envy those evil monsters
Stomping down, destroying towns and cities
But what I really want to destroy
Are these feelings within me

Through my lens, I see the town that I thought I had saved
But, when I look closely enough, I see that it's nothing but a diorama

Even my mantle, fluttering along in the head wind
Is now all tattered and full of holes
I can't really fly now, so would you lend me a hand?
Today ends with those words left unsaid, once again

Those words left unsaid
I'm drowning those words in my mask, once again

The belt I use to transform and my magical wand
They've stopped working at some point
If I could just throw all these away and face you head on
Will you be smiling when you see me?
Will you be the one to wipe away my tears?
