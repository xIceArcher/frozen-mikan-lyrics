If not crying is what makes someone strong
I'm sure humans would be the weakest creatures on this planet
When I hear about a sad news story, when your kindness touches me
I cry the same tears, how amazing is that?

When you fall over and get a fresh wound
When something so wonderful happens that I just want to jump around
If we won't be able to cry together anymore
I wouldn't mind becoming the weakest person on this planet

Things like what'll happen a hundred years from now
Or stars that are billions of light years away
We always end up talking about huge things that we'll never be able to reach
But what I really want to say is just something small
It's something really simple, so please listen
I'm sure, I'm sure I've fallen in love with you

I want to shout out, but for some reason I can't make a sound
I try my best to keep it in, but they always overflow
I've learnt about so many different things
But, for some reason, my emotions remain the biggest mystery

What appears in the mirror is nothing but a lie
Even photos always play their pranks on me
I'm sure that my true reflection can only be found
Within those eyes of yours

No matter who I'm with, or what I'm doing
I'll always feel like I'm alone
I wonder why, I really have no idea
But if you happen to feel the same way
I know that my uneasiness will disappear in a flash
That's just how our hearts overlap

Things like what'll happen a hundred years from now
Or stars that are billions of light years away
We always end up talking about huge things that we'll never be able to reach
But what I really want to say is just something small
It's something really simple, so please listen
I'm sure, I'm sure I've fallen in love with you
