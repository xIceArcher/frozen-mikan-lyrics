A voice, reaching no one, resounds through the night

Is this where hope is born, and where it is left to die?
"No!", that's not it, my flaming soul screams out in my heart

Fight back! I want to put up an even bigger fight
Hurry up! I want to believe, even more than before
Even more? The one truth I finally realized is...
It won't come true if you remain silent
It won't come true if through prayer alone, right now's the time to get moving

Pain and sighs prey on your dreams
A voice, reaching no one, resounds through the night
I won't accept it, I can't bear to lay my eyes on such a depressing world
I can feel the resonance... between you and I

We do not live to experience the taste of despair
"Run!", the whistle of my instincts wails out, deep in my heart

It's definitely wailing, more and more
It's fine even if it's wailing, more and more 
It'll finally reach a high, and nobody will be able to stop it
I'll make it come through, no matter what it takes
I'll make it come through with sheer willpower, anything is possible if I have my teeth bared

Light and prayers illuminate your dreams
Hoping for someone's pulse to overlap with the throbbing deep within you
Encountering you here in this world close to ruin was certainly not a coincidence
The resonance between you and I, leads to a deeper love

Pain and sighs prey on your dreams
But the light illuminates your dreams once again
Hoping for someone's pulse to overlap with the throbbing deep within you
Encountering you here in this world close to ruin was certainly not a coincidence
I can feel the resonance... between you and I
Let our voices resound through the night
