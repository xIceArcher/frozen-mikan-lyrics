“Good morning”, “Thank you”, “I’m sorry”
Voicing those syllables takes but a second
But, an entire lifetime might not be enough for me to convey 
The emotions behind those simple words

If it were possible to look right into someone else’s heart
Words and songs would probably never have existed
It’s because we don’t fully understand each other, because I can’t convey what I feel
That makes me want to stay by your side, makes me want to touch you

Over and over, over and over again
We exchange words, as if chanting a spell
Both my overflowing joy, and the sadness I try my best to keep in
These emotions keep multiplying, so much that I can’t bear it all by myself
It’s a spell allowing me to share them with you

The world might just vanish
Without a trace, in a blink
What should I say to make you laugh?
I’m serious about this, that’s why I need to convey what I feel

If only our lives would never come to an end
Then we need not be afraid of farewells
But, if I lost my fear of saying farewell
I’m sure I’d also forget the emotion that overwhelms me when we meet 

Over and over, over and over again
We exchange words, as if trying to pry open a locked door
Something even wider than the sky, something even deeper than the oceans
Something nobody has ever laid their eyes on, it lies beyond that door
And it’s the key to seeing that with our own eyes

Sometimes it’ll be a scream, and sometimes it’ll be a whisper
And sometimes it’ll be accompanied by a melody
A small flame illuminating the darkness
In order to uncover proof of the time we spent together

Over and over, over and over again
We exchange words, as if chanting a spell
Both my overflowing joy, and the sadness I try my best to keep in
These emotions keep multiplying, so much that I can’t bear it all by myself
It’s a spell allowing me to share them with you
You don’t need any special powers to use it
Everyone has the ability to use it, the magic of words
